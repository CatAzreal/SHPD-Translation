journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title,Introduction,基础介绍
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body,"Greetings Adventurer, you are reading the Tome of Dungeon Mastery. This book is full of tips and tricks to help budding adventurers survive and excel!\n\nThis guide is best used as a reference, and will magically let you know when is the best time to read each page.\n\n(Whenever the journal icon at the top-right blinks, the guidebook has something to tell you! Some pages seem to be ripped out of the book though, perhaps you can find them in the dungeon?)","向你致意，勇敢的冒险家。你正在阅览《地牢探索指南》，本书上旨在提供帮助新手冒险家存活并精进能力的提示和技巧！\n\n指南知晓何时是你翻开某一页并运用其上知识的最佳时机，因此你大可将之作为一本可靠的参考书。当你对地牢中的一些规则感到疑惑时，记得回来查阅这本书。\n\n(每当右上角的指南书图标闪烁，都代表着它有新的知识想要告诉你！不过，这本指南的一部分不知为何似乎被撕掉了，或许你可以在地牢里找到这些残页？)"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.title,Examining,审视周遭
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.body,"Rushing into enemies is almost never the best way to deal with them. It's important to study your opponents and surroundings to learn how to defeat them!\n\nExamining things also takes no time, so get in the habit of doing it to everything new you encounter.\n\n(You can examine something by using the magnifying glass button, and selecting the thing you want to examine. You can also examine buffs or debuffs by selecting their icons.)","对未知的事物保持敬畏与好奇！\n\n盲目鲁莽地一头冲进敌群会使你陷入困境甚至死亡，而这从来都不是最好的选择。游戏过程中你随时可以停下脚步，检视周围的事物和环境，得出击败敌人的最佳方案！\n\n检视的动作是瞬间完成的，这期间任何事物都来不及产生任何变化；养成检视新事物的习惯显然百利而无一害。\n\n(这个功能由放大镜按钮所提供，单击一次你就可以选择目标来检视。你还可以通过点击各个状态的图标来了解它们的具体效果。)"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title,Surprise Attacks,伏击
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body,"Rather than leaving combat up to chance, you can guarantee a hit on an enemy by using a surprise attack! This is especially useful against evasive enemies like snakes and wraiths.\n\nYou can surprise enemies by attacking them when they haven't seen you, or by using a door. If an enemy chases you through a door you can attack them right after they enter it and catch them by surprise!","“攻其不备，制其所长。”\n\n与其盼望攻击命中，不如借助伏击以必定命中敌人！这种技巧在对付幽灵与下水道巨蛇这类灵活的敌人时格外实用。\n\n在敌人没有看见你的时候发动攻击，即可形成一次伏击。也可以在敌人打开一扇门追击你的时候，回首一击，敌人不会反应过来的！\n\n伏击之法不胜枚举，且待你自行发掘。当你成功进行一次伏击后，一个黄色感叹号会在被你伏击的敌人身上闪现。"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title,Identifying Items,鉴定物品
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body,"You won't know all of the properties of some items when you first find them.\n\nThe colors of potions and symbols on scrolls are different in each dungeon. Unidentified equipment can be upgraded or enchanted if you're lucky, or it might be cursed!\n\nScrolls of identify, upgrade, or remove curse are very useful if you want to reduce the risk of using unidentified equipment.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the items tab of your journal)","地牢之大无奇不有，没人说得清手上初次见到的物品究竟有些什么效果。无论如何，谨慎为妙。\n\n药剂的颜色和卷轴的图案在每个地牢中都是完全随机的。装备虽然有着唯一的外观，却也常常有着不同的属性。手上的未鉴定装备若是被强化过的精品可算你走运，但坑害了无数同行的受诅咒的器物也不在少数；不小心穿上一件诅咒装备虽不至于让你立即陷入绝境，但也绝非好事。\n\n鉴定、升级、祛邪卷轴能够极大降低来自未鉴定物品的风险。\n\n(你可以在日志的道具列表里找到被你鉴定过的所有道具)"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title,Dealing with Hunger,与饥饿共舞
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body,"Rationing food effectively is one of the best things you can do to improve your odds of survival. Try thinking of health and hunger as resources that need to be managed, not kept full at all times.\n\nWhen you aren't starving you will slowly regenerate health. So if you eat at full health, this regeneration will be wasted.\n\nIf you pace out when you eat based on how your health is doing, your food should last much longer.","一粥一饭当思来之不易，尤其是在这暗无天日的地牢里！\n\n提高在地牢中生还率的最基本方法之一就是合理进食。请试着根据你的当前生命值状态合理分配食物，而不是总想着吃撑——那样你的食物供给可撑不了多久。\n\n在地牢里，生命值和饥饿值都要被当做资源来看待，而后者最终会影响到前者：极度饥饿时生命值会缓慢地流失，而平时生命值则会缓慢地恢复。显然，当你的生命值全满时，来自非饥饿状态的自然回复就会被白白浪费掉。\n\n虽然因饥饿而损失生命是一件很糟糕的事情，但无论如何只要你还活着，你的冒险就不会结束；合理分配食物则能让你在这座地牢里走得更远。"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.alchemy.title,Alchemy & Trinkets,炼金与饰物
journal.document.adventurers_guide.alchemy.body,"If you don't find a certain consumable item useful, you can use it as an ingredient at an alchemy pot instead! Items can be used in specific recipes, or turned into all-purpose alchemical energy. Energizing potions and scrolls also identifies them!\n\nTrinkets are the only piece of equipment that can be made using alchemy. They produce a variety of helpful effects and can be made with just a bit of alchemical energy and a magical catalyst. Trinkets can be upgraded with more energy to make their effect more powerful.\n\n(You can find the first alchemy pot on the 3rd or 4th floor of the dungeon. You can find pages of an alchemy recipe book near these pots as well.)","如果你找到一些用处不大的消耗品，你可以以它们作为原料放进炼金釜！这些消耗品既可用于特定的合成配方，也可以转化为万能的炼金能量。将药水与卷轴转化为炼金能量的过程也将鉴定它们！\n\n饰物是独一类通过炼金获得的装备。它们可提供各式各样的辅助效果，而仅需消耗少许炼金能量和一份魔能触媒就能炼成。消耗更多炼金能量可以升级饰物以增强它们的效果。\n\n(你可以在地牢的3或4层找到第一个炼金釜。炼金釜旁还可以找到一本炼金指南书的残页。)"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title,Handling Defeat,直视失败
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body,"Unfortunately, dungeoneering is a very dangerous profession and most adventurers will eventually meet their demise.\n\nWhile luck can definitely play a role, the best adventurers are the ones who use every little trick to improve their odds of success.\n\n(Don't be dissuaded if you are dying a lot, this game is hard! Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, don't focus on winning right away.)","失败是成功之母！\n\n非常非常不幸的是，地牢冒险家是一个十分危险而又充满挑战的职业，而大部分从事者都会在地牢深处走到人生的终点。\n\n运气固然重要，但最老练的冒险家们真正依赖的是他们的深思熟虑，与一步又一步细微但巧妙的行动在最后累积出的巨大优势。\n\n(头几次尝试可能都会失败，毕竟这个游戏并不简单！因此，请将注意力集中在理解游戏机制上，借此稳步提升自己的技巧，这样下去相信你离最终的胜利会越来越近；而这比一心只想着赢、却从不琢磨如何才能做得更好要强得多。)"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.title,Searching,仔细摸索
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.body,"Dungeons are full of secret doorways and traps which appear invisible at first glance. Searching takes time, but is very useful if you suspect something is hidden.\n\nSearch near walls if you suspect a door is hidden, or around floors if you suspect a trap is hidden.\n\n(You can search all the tiles around you by using the magnifying glass button twice. Anything that's hidden in these tiles will be revealed. Maybe there are some hidden doors near where you found this page!)","可别让表象欺骗了你；不管你是否看见了它，已存在的事物总还是存在的。\n\n地牢里面充满了暗门和陷阱，初见时通常无法直接发现。如果你认为哪片区域不对劲，仔细搜索这片区域也许是一个不错的选择，即使这会花费一些时间。\n\n搜索可以发现你墙上的暗门与地上的陷阱。\n\n(通过双击放大镜按钮，你可以搜索临近身旁的所有格子，其间隐藏的事物都会被揭示。指不定你捡到这一页指南的地方附近就有几扇暗门呢！)"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title,Strength,野蛮其体魄
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body,"There won't be any time to train with weapons and armor you find in the dungeon, so you'll need brute strength to use them effectively.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are the most effective way to meet the strength requirements of higher tier gear.\n\nIt's important to work towards using high tier items, but don't completely ignore equipment you can use sooner. Once you're deep enough in the dungeon you'll need high tier gear to survive, but you have to survive long enough to equip them first!","思虑再为周全，也需要足够的肉体力量将之付诸实践。\n\n在地牢中你没有时间通过训练来掌握新武器和护甲，唯有借助蛮力才能有效地使用它们。\n\n力量药剂与升级卷轴是满足高阶装备力量需求的最有效途径。\n\n拿上更重也更强的高阶武器与护甲非常重要，但也不能完全忽略能很快用上的低阶装备。当你足够深入地牢时，高阶的装备能为你提供长足的帮助——前提是你能活着去到地牢深处！"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.title,Upgrades,欲善其事先利其器
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.body,"The deeper you go into a dungeon, the more important it is that you're using magically enhanced high tier gear.\n\nHigher tier weapons and armor gain more power from upgrades, but you'll also need the strength to use them properly. Wands, rings, and artifacts don't need strength, but have limited usages or don't help as directly in combat.\n\nMaking good choices about what you upgrade is very important for surviving early in the dungeon, and for setting yourself up for success later in the dungeon.","使用升级过的装备可让你事半功倍！\n\n越深入地牢，越依赖强化装备。\n\n升级可以略微降低武器与护甲的力量需求，而高阶武器与护甲还能从其中获得更多收益；而诸如法杖、戒指、神器等虽没有力量需求，但升级后也能提供更强的协助。\n\n选择你所升级的对象至关重要，这既能保证你在前期的生存，也能在后期助你决胜于地牢至深处，不可不察也。"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.title,Effective Looting,搜刮技巧
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.body,"Specific rooms will often contain better loot. Some of these rooms will be behind locked doors, or will contain obstacles which must be overcome.\n\nWhenever an obstacle blocks your progress, look for a solution nearby. You can usually find an item to help you on the same floor.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are an excellent benchmark of how well you're exploring and looting. You will be able to find 2 potions of strength and 3 scrolls of upgrade in each five floor dungeon region.\n\n(You can see a list of important landmarks and unused keys in the notes tab of the journal window.)","危险总与机遇并存，地牢里值得搜刮的宝物多如繁星；毕竟你正是冲着它们才来到了这里啊。\n\n特殊房间中常常有着比普通房间中更好的物品。有些特殊房间会被上锁，或者被障碍封锁。\n\n当然，如果出现了这样的房间，那么这一层肯定会有相应的道具——钥匙或者其他道具，来帮助你解除这里的障碍。\n\n搜寻到力量药剂和升级卷轴的数量是你对地牢探索程度的重要标准。每个地牢区域都有3张升级卷轴和2瓶力量药剂。\n\n(你可以在右上角的日志栏里查看当前你所未使用的钥匙和遇到过的特殊房间。)"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title,Gaining Experience,经验获取
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body,"Your experience level boosts your accuracy, evasion, health, and awards talent points. All of these can make a big difference in combat. It's best to have at least one level for each floor of the dungeon.\n\nIt can be tempting to rush through a dungeon, avoiding exploration and combat, but doing so will deprive you of both supplies and experience.\n\n(You can see information about your hero, including exp, on the status pane at the corner of the game interface. Select your hero portrait to get even more info.)","没能杀死你的都使你变得更强！\n\n随着你击败敌人的增多，你的作战经验也会随之增长。获得的经验等级决定了你战斗的精准、闪避，你的生命总量，以及你的天赋点数。你的经验等级对于战斗有着非常可观的影响。强烈建议你的等级至少和当前的地牢层数相等。\n\n速通地牢，省去探索和战斗之苦听起来非常诱人，但是这样做会让你失去获得补给和经验值的机会。\n\n(你可以在屏幕角落的状态栏中看见你的角色状态，包括经验与等级。点击英雄图标还可以获得更多的信息)"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.title,Positioning,择地而战
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.body,"Effectively fighting enemies depends on good strategy as well as strong equipment. Bad situations like getting surrounded can usually be avoided with good positioning.\n\nFor instance, most dungeons have thin corridors, which are excellent at forcing enemies to fight you one at a time. These corridors often have doorways too, which can be used for surprise attacks!\n\nThere are lots of little ways to use environmental features like grass, water, or traps to your advantage as well.","“夫地形者，兵之助也。料敌制胜，计险隘远近，上将之道也。”\n\n与敌人战斗时，合适的策略与强力的装备同样重要。选择恰当的作战地形能让你远离诸如被强敌包围这样严峻的形势。\n\n例如，狭窄的走廊是地牢中极其常见的一种地形，这让你一次只需面对一个敌人。这些走廊通常也毗邻门道，可以用来发动伏击！\n\n请合理决策，各种环境特征——植被、水潭、陷阱等等，都可以为你所用。"
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title,Magical Attacks,魔法攻击
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body,"Magical attacks cut right through armor and are extremely difficult to dodge. This means that your wands will be very reliable, but also makes magical enemies extremely dangerous!\n\nMagical attacks always have a drawback though. Wands have limited charges and magical enemies usually won't be able to use their magic in close range.\n\nWhen facing enemies that use magic it is important to learn how to prevent them from using it on you.","魔法之中蕴藏着比兵刃更为巨大的力量。\n\n魔法攻击会直接穿透护甲且极难闪避。这意味着法杖拥有非常可靠的输出能力，但同样也让敌方魔法生物变得异常危险！\n\n不过，魔法攻击并非十全十美。消耗完充能的法杖就是一根无用的短棍，经过一定时间才能恢复；敌方魔法生物们通常也不会在近距离使用它们独有的魔法力量。\n\n面对敌人的魔法攻击时，学会巧妙躲避这些魔法永远比硬抗伤害来得更加有效。"

journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.title,Energy and Food,炼金能量与食物烹饪
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.body,"Many recipes require crystal alchemical energy, which is produced by deconstructing consumable items in an alchemy pot. More powerful items produce more energy, and energizing potions or scrolls also identifies them.\n\nSome recipes that require energy are magical, but these ones resemble traditional cooking.","许多配方都需要炼金能量晶体的参与，而这些晶体可以借助炼金釜从消耗品中提炼而来。物品的力量越是强大，所能提供的炼金能量就越多，而在使用药水或卷轴来供能时，这一操作也将鉴定它们。\n\n尽管一些配方神秘莫测，但这些配方比起炼金更像是烹饪。"

It's time to start your own adventure!","在你之前，也曾经有很多来自地面的英雄向这个地牢进发，然而多数人却是一去不返。\n\n传说在地牢的最深处藏着万能的Yendor护符，被深渊中的远古邪物守卫着。哪怕是现在，黑暗能量也从地下辐射而来，一路渗透到地表城镇中。\n\n准备好踏破地牢，探秘护符了吗？是时候开始你自己的冒险了！"

journal.document.intros.prison.body,"Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...","多年以前，一座地下监狱为了收容危险的犯罪者而被建立于此。由于其严格的监管和高安全性，地表各处的囚犯都被带到这里经受时间的折磨。\n\n但不久之后，下方充斥着黑暗的瘴气便在这里弥漫开来，扭曲了罪犯和狱卒的心智。\n\n监狱里充斥开来的混乱使其彻底失去了秩序，城市也因此封锁了整个监狱。现今已没有人知道这些高墙之下经历过无数死亡的生物究竟会是什么样子..."

That might be excessive, but I mustn't take too long deciding or they'll get suspicious.\n\nI think I'll call this great power the Amulet of Yendor!\n- R.","吾成功了！\n\n尽管无法彻底理解吾发现的事物本质，但其存在本身已经超出了任何想象。如此充沛的力量，就这么驻留于此任人攫取，它属于吾了！\n\n有了这股力量，议会里的蠢货们再也不能反对吾了。吾开始激动地思考狠狠羞辱这些蠢货的各种手段方式。不对，格局要放开点，吾掌握的力量可以轻易抹除他们所有人！这么做也许略显极端，可吾也不能在这件事上拖延过久导致他们产生不必要的猜疑。\n\n吾决定将此力量命名为Yendor护符！\n——R."

journal.document.halls_king.ritual.body,"Thymor publicly confronted me earlier today and insisted I explain my new source of power. I dismissed him as best I could, but I can feel the judging eyes of the rest of the court on me once again.\n\nI had hoped to spend a little more time enjoying the calm before the storm, but it doesn't really matter. I've decided what I want to do. I will claim I gained my power through a new ritual, and will offer to perform it on the other warlocks and the King. Once the ritual is over, I will be king!\n\nThymor will protest, of course, but with this much power on offer I doubt they will listen to him!\n\nALL WILL BOW BEFORE ME!\n- Future King of the Dwarves","今日提穆尔同吾在议会上公开对峙，要求吾对自身新的力量做出解释。吾尽可能打发掉了提穆尔的说法，不过议会其余成员猜疑的目光又一次集中在吾身上。\n\n吾本希望好戏在正式开场前能享受片刻安宁，不过这已经不重要了，因为吾意已决。吾将宣称自身改变源于一场新的仪式，并愿意为其他术士和现任国王施展并赋予同等力量。仪式成功后，吾，不，朕就是国王了！\n\n提穆尔肯定会一如往常地反对朕，但有如此强大的力量为饵，不会有人再去听信他一人之言！\n\n所有人都将跪倒在朕御前！\n——下一任矮人国王"

journal.document.halls_king.new_king.body,"I AM KING, AHAHAHAHAAA!\n\nThey just let me do it! With hardly any convincing they agreed to let me 'share' this power with them in a great ritual. In an instant they were transformed from a chorus of mocking voices to my new court of silent subjects!\n\nPredictably, Thymor fled like a coward at the first sign of trouble. I can already feel the resistance force he is building as well. I think I'll allow him to continue, so that he can deliver all of his conspirators right to my door!\n\nClearly the kingdom doesn't respect me either, I suppose I'll fix that as well.\n- King of the Dwarves","啊哈哈哈哈哈，朕即位了！\n\n这群蠢货竟然真的同意了！还没等朕打算认真说服，他们就同意参与朕这场为了和他们“共享”力量而举行的大型仪式。只消一会，这群喋喋不休且傲慢不已的蠢货就都转化成了沉默且服从的新议会眷属！\n\n如朕所料，提穆尔在发现情况不对的第一时间就仓皇而逃。朕也能感知到他在外界试图组建的叛军。朕打算坐享其成，让他帮朕将这些反抗者都聚集于此一网打尽！\n\n很明显，就连这个国家都不尊重我这个新王，新官上任尚且需要三把火，新王登基自然不能矮了身段。\n——矮人国王"

journal.document.halls_king.thing.body,"There's a problem. Thymor was dispatched without effort, but it seems my scrounging in the outer planes did not go unnoticed.\n\nSome... 'thing'... has been attracted to my world and is starting to force itself through at the bottom of the lower halls. To complicate things further, that is the exact location where I stored the amulet! Such a spiteful creature, why must it try to deny me my power when there is plenty out there still to take?\n\nDespite my power though, I don't think I can just charge in and fight it. Its true power is unfathomable, but there must be some way to limit it. I WILL DEFEND MY PRIZE!","有麻烦了，虽然和提穆尔没什么关系，他苍白无力的抵抗早已被迅速扑灭，不过朕在外位面的探索似乎吸引到了不必要的注意。\n\n一个...“存在”...被引到了本位面，祂正在逼近城市厅堂的最下层。麻烦的事情在于，那也正好是朕存放护符的区域！真是个可憎的造物，为何放着外位面充盈的能量不要，专门跑来试图夺走朕的东西？\n\n纵是强大如朕，也无法亲征讨伐此怪。其真实实力不可估量，但朕也有可行之策。朕必会守住护符！"

journal.document.halls_king.attrition.body,"I have a plan for dealing with the thing. Its power is infinite, but its ability to encroach on this world is not. It's relying on minions and avatars to do its bidding while it tries to build enough power to take the amulet.\n\nWhile I don't possess the amulet physically I still have full control over its power. With the entire dwarven city at my disposal I also have a numbers advantage. I can simply keep sending soldiers to prevent it from seizing the amulet and steadily win this war through attrition!\n\nI, RODNEY, KING OF DWARVES, WILL OUTLAST YOU YOG-DZEWA!","朕已有一计可应对此孽。诚然其力量几近无限，然其蚕食本位面的能力受限颇多。祂仍需其恶魔爪牙与化身的协助才能积蓄力量，一举夺走护符。\n\n护符虽不在身旁，但其神力仍寄宿于朕。掌控矮人都城本身也意味着朕有压倒性的人数优势。将兵力源源不断地送入大厅，朕就能阻止其攫取护符，通过消耗战赢得胜利！\n\nYog-Dzewa！朕，Rodney，矮人之王，才 会 笑 到 最 后！"
