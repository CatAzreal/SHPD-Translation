journal.document.adventurers_guide.title,Tome of Dungeon Mastery,地牢探索指南
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.title,Introduction,基础介绍
journal.document.adventurers_guide.intro.body,"Greetings Adventurer, you are reading the Tome of Dungeon Mastery! This guidebook is best used as a reference, and will magically let you know when it's best to read each page.\n\n(When the journal button flashes, select it to read what the guidebook has to tell you! Some pages are missing though, perhaps you can find them in the dungeon?)",你好冒险家，你正在阅读《地牢探索指南》！本指南作为你最好的第一手资料，能够神奇地为你指出阅读每页的最佳时机。\n\n(每当日志按钮闪烁时，点选其以阅读指南所要传授于你的教程！不过，指南遗失了部分书页，或许你可以在地牢中找到其余部分？)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.title,Examining,审视周遭
journal.document.adventurers_guide.examining.body,It's important to study your enemies and surroundings instead of rushing in blindly! Get in the habit of examining everything new.\n\n(You can examine by using the magnifying glass button and then selecting what you want to examine. You can also examine buffs or debuffs by selecting their icons.),相较于有勇无谋地冲锋陷阵，对你的敌人与环境进行分析至关重要。正所谓知己知彼，百战不殆。\n\n(你可以通过使用放大镜按钮选择任意事物进行检视。你还可以通过选择增益或减益的图标检视其效果。)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.title,Surprise Attacks,伏击
journal.document.adventurers_guide.surprise_attacks.body,"Surprise attacks are guaranteed to hit, making them especially useful against evasive enemies like snakes and wraiths.\n\nYou can surprise enemies right after they enter a doorway while chasing you, or when they otherwise lose sight of you.",伏击必定命中敌人，使其对蛇与怨灵等高闪避敌人效果显著。\n\n你可以在敌人追击你途中诱敌至门处之后立刻反击，或在敌人视野盲区内攻击以进行伏击。
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.title,Identifying Items,鉴定物品
journal.document.adventurers_guide.identifying.body,"The colors of potions and symbols on scrolls are different in each dungeon. Unidentified equipment can be upgraded or enchanted if you're lucky, or it might be cursed!\n\nScrolls of identify, upgrade, or remove curse are very useful if you want to reduce the risk of using unidentified equipment.\n\n(You can find a list of all the items you've identified in the catalog tab of your journal)",每个地牢中的药剂颜色与卷轴符文均不一致。运气好的话，你会找到一些被升级或附魔过的未鉴定装备，但未鉴定装备同样有可能附有诅咒！\n\n鉴定、升级或祛邪卷轴对于降低使用未鉴定的物品的风险非常有用。\n\n(你可以在日志的道具列表找到被你鉴定过的所有物品。)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.title,Dealing with Hunger,与饥饿共舞
journal.document.adventurers_guide.food.body,"Rationing effectively is one of the best ways to improve your odds of survival, you don't always need to eat right when you get hungry!\n\nWhen you aren't starving you will slowly regenerate health, so if you eat at full health that regeneration will be wasted!\n\nIf you pace out when you eat based on your health, your food will last much longer.",高效规划食物是提升你存活率的当务之急之一。你并不总是需要在你有些饿的时候就立刻进食。\n\n只要你不处于极度饥饿状态，你就能缓慢恢复生命值。因此如果你在满血状态下进食，就会白白浪费掉恢复效果。\n\n如果你基于自身健康状况调整进食节律，你的食物就能保存的更久。
journal.document.adventurers_guide.alchemy.title,Alchemy & Trinkets,炼金与饰物
journal.document.adventurers_guide.alchemy.body,"If you don't find a consumable item useful, you can use it as an alchemy ingredient or turn it into all-purpose alchemical energy. Energizing potions and scrolls also identifies them!\n\nTrinkets are a unique kind of equipment that are created and upgraded using alchemy. They're made with a magical trinket catalyst and a bit of alchemical energy.\n\n(The first alchemy pot is on the 3rd or 4th floor of the dungeon. There are alchemy recipe book pages near these pots as well.)",如果你找到了一些无用的消耗品，你可将其作为炼金原料火转化为万金油般的炼金能量。转化药水与卷轴为炼金能量还会将其鉴定！\n\n饰物是一类通过炼金制作并升级的独特装备。制作饰物仅需使用一份魔能触媒与少许炼金能量。\n\n(首个炼金釜必定生成与地牢的3或4层。炼金釜旁还可以找到炼金指南的残页。)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.title,Handling Defeat,直视失败
journal.document.adventurers_guide.dieing.body,"Dungeoneering is dangerous and most adventurers eventually meet their demise.\n\nLuck helps, but the best adventurers use every little trick to improve their chances.\n\n(Don't be upset if you are dying a lot, this game is hard! Focus on learning the game and steadily improving, not on winning right away.)",人生自古谁无死？不幸地，深入地牢是一项十分危险的挑战，而大部分冒险家都会在其中走到人生的终点。\n\n运气固然重要，但最优秀的冒险家会用尽深思熟虑以提高其胜率。\n\n(如果多次失败请不要灰心，毕竟这个游戏并不简单！请更多地专注于学习机制并稳步提高，而非片刻的胜利上。)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.title,Searching,仔细摸索
journal.document.adventurers_guide.searching.body,Dungeons are full of secret doors and traps that appear invisible at first glance. You can spend some time and carefully search if you suspect a door or trap is hidden nearby.\n\n(You can search all the tiles around you by using the magnifying glass button twice. Maybe there are some hidden doors near where you found this page!),地牢中充满了仅凭肉眼不可见的暗门和陷阱。如果你怀疑有暗门或陷阱的话，你可以花费些许时间仔细搜索一下。\n\n(你可以通过使用两次放大镜按钮搜索周围所有格。没准你捡到这页指南的旁边就有几扇暗门呢！)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.title,Strength,野蛮其体魄
journal.document.adventurers_guide.strength.body,"There isn't time to train with weapons and armor you find in the dungeon, so you'll need brute strength to use them effectively.\n\nPotions of strength and scrolls of upgrade are the most effective way to meet the strength requirements of higher tier gear.\n\nIt's important to eventually start using high tier items, but don't ignore equipment you can use right now.",你没有时间用地牢中的武器护甲进行训练，因此你必须凭借蛮力才能有效使用它们。\n\n力量药剂与升级卷轴是满足高阶装备力量需求的最有效的途径。\n\n以使用高阶装备为最终目标而努力固然重要，但也不要完全忽视可解燃眉之急的低阶装备。
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.title,Upgrades,欲善其事先利其器
journal.document.adventurers_guide.upgrades.body,"The deeper you go into a dungeon, the more important it is that you're using magically upgraded high tier gear, but you'll also need the strength to use them properly.\n\nWands, rings, and artifacts don't need strength, but have limited usages or don't help as directly in combat.\n\nMaking good choices about what you upgrade is very important for surviving early in the dungeon, and for setting yourself up for success later in the dungeon.",越深入地牢，高级高阶装备对你就越重要。武器护甲阶数越高，从升级中获益也越多，但你仍需要力量以恰当地使用它们。\n\n虽然法杖、戒指、神器没有力量需求，但它们用途有限或对战斗不起直接作用。\n\n选择升级对象之前请三思而后行，这不但对保障你前期的生存来说至关重要，也能为你后期的地牢冒险做足准备。
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.title,Effective Looting,搜刮技巧
journal.document.adventurers_guide.looting.body,"Rooms that are behind locked doors or that contain obstacles usually have better loot. When an obstacle blocks your path, you can usually find an item to help on the same floor.\n\nYou will always be able to find 2 potions of strength and 3 scrolls of upgrade in each five floor dungeon region, so they're a great indicator of how well you're exploring.\n\n(You can see a list of landmarks and unused keys in the notes tab of the journal window.)",上锁或是被障碍挡住的房间内通常有更好的战利品。每当你找到这样的障碍，都可以在同一层找到解决它们的物品。\n\n你能在每个以五楼为一个单位的地牢区域中中找到2瓶力量药剂和3张升级卷轴，因此此二者是衡量你探索充分程度的绝佳指标。\n\n(你可以在日志的手册中看到重要地标和未用的钥匙的列表。)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.title,Gaining Experience,经验获取
journal.document.adventurers_guide.levelling.body,"Levelling up boosts your stats and awards talent points, which can make a big difference in combat. It's best to have at least one level for each floor of the dungeon.\n\nIt can be tempting to rush and avoiding exploration or combat, but doing so will deprive you of supplies and experience.\n\n(You can see information about your hero, including exp, on the status pane at the corner of the game interface. Select your hero portrait to get even more info.)",升级会为你强化属性，奖励天赋点，其均能对战斗发挥着重要作用。最好确保每深入一层地牢就至少升一级。\n\n速通地牢，避免探索和战斗听起来非常诱人，但是这样做会让你失去获得补给品和经验值的机会。\n\n(你可以在游戏界面边角的状态栏中看见包括经验值在内的英雄相关信息。点选英雄图标还可以获得更多信息。)
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.title,Positioning,择地而战
journal.document.adventurers_guide.positioning.body,"Strategy is just as important as equipment. Bad situations like getting surrounded can usually be avoided with good positioning.\n\nFor instance, most dungeons have thin corridors which force enemies to fight you one at a time. These corridors often have doorways for surprice attacks too!\n\nThere are lots of little ways to use environment features like grass, water, pits, or traps to your advantage as well.",深思熟虑的重要性并不亚于厉兵秣马。被包围的糟糕的局面通常可被凭良好的地势避免。\n\n例如，狭窄的走廊在地牢中极其常见，对于迫使敌人与你决斗效果绝佳。这些走廊通常也包含有可用于进行伏击的门。\n\n还有各种手段可以利用植被、水体或陷阱以为你创造战斗优势。
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.title,Magical Attacks,魔法攻击
journal.document.adventurers_guide.magic.body,"Magical attacks cut right through armor and are difficult to dodge. This means that damage from wands is very reliable, but also makes magical enemies very dangerous!\n\nMagical attacks always have a drawback though. Wands have limited charges and magical enemies usually won't be able to use their magic in close range.\n\nWhen facing enemies that use magic it is important to learn how to prevent them from using it on you.",魔法攻击可以穿透护甲且难以闪避。这意味着法杖拥有非常可靠的输出能力，不过与此同时这也使得法术系敌人变得异常危险！\n\n不过，魔法攻击并非无懈可击。法杖充能有限，而法术系敌人也通常不会近距离施放法术。\n\n面对法术系敌人的攻击时，学会如何规避魔法攻击至关重要。
journal.document.alchemy_guide.title,Alchemy Guide,炼金指南
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.title,Intro and Potions,引言与入门配方
journal.document.alchemy_guide.potions.body,"Welcome to Practical Applications of Alchemy! This book is a reference of recipes to craft items at an alchemy pot.\n\nWe'll start with the most iconic recipe: Potions!\n\nUse three seeds to brew a random potion! Every seed has a potion counterpart, use multiple of the same seed to increase the chance that the potion relates to the seeds you used.",欢迎来到《炼金术的实际应用》！你可以参照配方来使用炼金釜创造出新的物品。\n\n我们先介绍最经典的配方：药剂！\n\n使用三枚种子即可酿造出一瓶随机药剂！每类植物的种子均对应一种药剂，使用多枚相同的种子以增加酿造出与你使用的种子对应的药剂的概率。
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.title,Creating Runestones,锻造符石
journal.document.alchemy_guide.stones.body,Mixing a scroll into an alchemy pot will imbue its magic into two rocks within the pot. This creates runestones and identifies the scroll!,将一张卷轴与两个石块投入炼金釜当中，便可以将卷轴的魔力灌注到石块当中。在鉴定该卷轴的同时，对应的符石也被锻造成形！
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.title,Energy and Food,炼金能量与食物烹饪
journal.document.alchemy_guide.energy_food.body,"Many recipes require crystal alchemical energy, which is made by deconstructing consumable items in an alchemy pot. Energizing potions or scrolls also identifies them.\n\nSome recipes that require energy are magical, but these ones resemble traditional cooking.",许多配方都需要炼金能量晶体参与，这些晶体可以借助炼金釜从消耗品中提炼而来。提炼未知的卷轴或药水时也会将其鉴定。\n\n一些需要炼金能量的配方看上去神秘莫测，但这些比起炼金配方更像烹饪食谱。
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.title,Exotic Potions,酿造合剂
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_potions.body,"Potions can be mixed with energy to create exotic potions. They have more powerful effects, but are often useful in different ways.",普通药剂可以注入炼金能量，强化为合剂。合剂拥有更强大的药效，不过作用方式通常与原药剂有所出入。
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.title,Exotic Scrolls,合成秘卷
journal.document.alchemy_guide.exotic_scrolls.body,Exotic scrolls can be made with some energy and a scroll. They're a bit stronger and more expensive than exotic potions.,将一张卷轴与一些炼金能量共炼可获得秘卷。秘卷相较于合剂更为强大，但显然也更昂贵。
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.title,Enhanced Bombs,改造炸弹
journal.document.alchemy_guide.bombs.body,A standard black powder bomb can be mixed with a specific item to create an enhanced bomb.,一个标准的黑火药炸弹可以与一个特定的物品共炼来制作一个强化炸弹。
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.title,Enhancing Weapons,强化武器
journal.document.alchemy_guide.weapons.body,"Some of the lighter or more magical weapons can be used in alchemy!\n\nEach thrown weapon set produces enough liquid metal to fully repair another set of the same level and tier. Note that alchemizing a set will destroy the whole set, even if it isn't all present!\n\nOne wand will produce enough arcane resin to upgrade two wands of the same level, but no higher than +3.",投掷武器与法杖也可参与到炼金反应当中！\n\n投掷武器组可被熔化为一定量的液金，足以完全修复一组同阶同级的投掷武器。注意，无论这组武器的完整度如何，使用投掷武器组炼金必定会将整组武器彻底摧毁！\n\n法杖可被裂化为一定量的奥术树脂，足以升级两把同等级的法杖，然而此法无法将法杖升级至+3以上。
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.title,Brews and Elixirs,炼制魔药与秘药
journal.document.alchemy_guide.brews_elixirs.body,"Brews and elixirs are advanced potions with a variety of effects, usually with a single use.",魔药与秘药是较为高级的药剂，它们具有不同用途的各类效果，通常为一次性使用。
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.title,Spells,提取结晶
journal.document.alchemy_guide.spells.body,"Spells are contained in crystals and provide a variety of effects, usually with multiple uses.",法术结晶是封装于结晶中的法术，它们提供不同用途的各类效果，通常允许多次使用。

journal.document.intros.dungeon.title,Dungeon,地牢
journal.document.intros.dungeon.body,"Many heroes have ventured into the dungeon before you from the city above, most have never been heard from again.\n\nIt is said that an ancient evil lurks in the depths, guarding the almighty Amulet of Yendor. Even now dark energy radiates from below, making its way up into the city.\n\nWill you conquer the dungeon and claim the amulet? It's time to start your own adventure!",在你之前，也曾经有很多来自地面的英雄向这个地牢进发，然而多数人却是一去不返。\n\n传说在地牢的最深处藏着万能的Yendor护符，被深渊中的远古邪物守卫着。哪怕是现在，黑暗能量也从地下辐射而来，一路渗透到地表城镇中。\n\n准备好踏破地牢，探秘护符了吗？是时候开始你自己的冒险了！
journal.document.intros.sewers.title,Sewers,下水道
journal.document.intros.sewers.body,"The upper floors of the dungeon actually constitute the city's sewer system.\n\nAs dark energy has crept up from below the usually harmless sewer creatures have become more and more ferocious. The city has had to send guard patrols down here to try and maintain safety for those above.\n\nThis place is dangerous, but at least the evil magic at work here is weak.",这座地牢的较上层其实是由城市的下水道系统组成的。\n\n由于下方不断渗透的黑暗能量，其中本应无害的下水道生物变得越来越危险。城市曾向这里派出巡逻队并试图以此保护其上方的区域。\n\n这片区域已经具有一定的危险性，不过至少邪恶魔法对这里的影响尚属薄弱。
journal.document.intros.prison.title,Prison,监狱
journal.document.intros.prison.body,"Many years ago a prison was built here to house dangerous criminals. Tightly regulated and secure, convicts from all over the land were brought here to serve time.\n\nBut soon dark miasma started to creep from below, twisting the minds of guard and prisoner alike.\n\nIn response to the mounting chaos, the city sealed off the entire prison. Nobody knows what became of those who were left for dead within these walls...",多年以前，一座地下监狱为了收容危险的犯罪者而被建立于此。由于其严格的监管和高安全性，地表各处的囚犯都被带到这里经受时间的折磨。\n\n但不久之后，下方充斥着黑暗的瘴气便在这里弥漫开来，扭曲了罪犯和狱卒的心智。\n\n监狱里充斥开来的混乱使其彻底失去了秩序，城市也因此封锁了整个监狱。现今已没有人知道这些高墙之下经历过无数死亡的生物究竟会是什么样子...
journal.document.intros.caves.title,Caves,洞穴
journal.document.intros.caves.body,"These sparsely populated caves stretch down under the abandoned prison. Rich in minerals, they were once a center of bustling trade and industry for the dwarven society below, but they were abandoned as the dwarves became obsessed with dark magic.\n\nThe caves are now mostly inhabited by subterranean wildlife, gnolls, and derelict machinery; likely corrupted by the same power that has affected the regions above.",这座从废弃监狱延伸而下的洞穴，早已空无一人。矿产丰富的洞穴曾经是下方矮人国度的一个贸易与工业中心。然而随着矮人逐渐堕入黑暗魔法的深渊，这里也慢慢被废弃了。\n\n大抵只有地下生物与豺狼人居住在这荒凉的洞穴之中，偶尔能看到废弃的机械。与之前的区域类似，这里的活物似乎也被同一种邪恶力量所扭曲。
journal.document.intros.city.title,Dwarven Metropolis,矮人都城
journal.document.intros.city.body,"The Dwarven Metropolis was once the greatest of all dwarven city-states. In its heyday the dwarves built wondrous machines of metal and magic that allowed their city to expand rapidly.\n\nThen, one day, the city gates were barred and nobody heard from the dwarves again. The few who escaped the city as it closed told stories of a mad warlock who stole the throne, and the terrible magic he had learned to harness.",矮人都城曾经是众矮人城邦之中最为宏伟的一座。在其鼎盛时期，矮人制造了一批注入魔力的奇特机械，借此快速扩张矮人城邦。\n\n然而突然有一天，城邦的大门被紧闭，从此外界再也没有得到矮人的消息。据几位侥幸逃脱的矮人说，有一位癫狂的矮人篡夺了王位，并利用他掌控的黑暗魔法巩固了其统治的地位。
journal.document.intros.halls.title,Demon Halls,恶魔大厅
journal.document.intros.halls.body,"These deep halls of the Dwarven Metropolis have been twisted by dark magic. In the past these regions played host to the Dwarf King's court of elite warlocks, but now they seem to have been taken over by something even more sinister...\n\nAll sorts of horrific demonic creatures inhabit these halls, being led by some terrible dark power. If the King of Dwarves wasn't the source of the spreading corruption, whatever is down here must be.\n\nTread carefully, very few adventurers have ever descended this far...",矮人都城深处的厅堂已经被恶魔力量扭曲。这里曾经由矮人国王手下的精英术士们做主，但他们似乎已经被某些更加邪恶强大的存在所取代...\n\n恶魔生物们盘踞着这些大厅。令人胆寒的黑暗意志主宰着它们。既然矮人国王不是腐化的根源，那真正的它一定就藏在这里！\n\n路上要小心，很少有冒险家能一路走到这里...

journal.document.sewers_guard.new_position.body,"85th of Autumn, 375\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nI told you all the hard work at the city guard would pay off. I just got promoted!\n\nI've been invited to join a specialist team that works in the sewers. Apparently there are problems with vermin and outlaws down there, and it's our job to clear them out. It's messy work, but the sewers are warm in the winter and it pays three times as much as regular guard duty!\n\nIt's all a bit secretive though, so I can't actually send this letter. It feels weird to not write to you, so I'm going to keep writing them anyway. Maybe I can show them to you one day.\n\nBest,\n- Sonya",秋临八十五日，叁柒伍年\n亲爱的爸妈，\n\n早和你们说过我当城市守卫时干得那么辛苦不会没有回报的——我刚刚升职啦！\n\n我被邀请加入一个特别调研队，得调到下水道那边去工作。也许是那里害虫太多了吧——说不定还藏了不少小毛贼呢——现如今得轮到我们去好好收拾它们了。虽说活儿有点麻烦，不过到了冬天下水道里好歹暖和点，更别说工资可比普通城卫高了足足两倍！\n\n这差事好是好，但却是对外保密的，结果我也送不出这封信了；但不给你们写信我心里又难受，因此我就继续写下去好了。说不定哪天等我回来了，能亲自把这些信拿给你们看。\n\n祝安好。\n——桑雅
journal.document.sewers_guard.dangerous.title,A Dangerous Position...,危险工种...
journal.document.sewers_guard.dangerous.body,"88th of Autumn, 375\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nI understand why the pay is so good now, the sewers are infested with monsters! The 'vermin' and 'outlaws' are giant bloodthirsty rats and packs of angry gnolls.\n\nThankfully the rest of my team really knows what they're doing. Our team captain, Thomas, is an expert at this. I'm trying to learn quickly so that I'm not too much of a burden.\n\nThis job is a lot more dangerous than I thought. I'm glad I can't send these now, I don't want you to worry.\n\nI'll keep safe,\n- Sonya",秋临八十八日，叁柒伍年\n亲爱的爸妈，\n\n我可算知道这岗位待遇为什么这么好了——下水道里尽是些怪物！这哪是什么“害虫”和“小毛贼”啊，明明就是嗜血的巨鼠和一群群狂怒的豺狼人！\n\n谢天谢地，我的队友们对自己的工作还是有经验的。比如说我们调研队的队长，托马斯，他对付起这些怪物就颇有一套。我也在尽可能快地学习这一切，什么时候能不当累赘了最好。\n\n这份工作比我设想的危险得多。现在想想，这些信送不出去也是好事；我可不想让你们两个担心。\n\n我会注意安全的。\n——桑雅

journal.document.sewers_guard.crabs.body,"11th of Winter, 376\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nAs if the rats weren't bad enough, deeper down there are giant crabs! One of them charged right past me and got Lee pretty badly before we killed it. Thomas says it's not my fault, but I know he's just trying to be nice to me.\n\nThankfully, on our way out we ran into an adventurer who had some spare sungrass salve. Lee might not have made it without that stuff.\n\nI saw the adventurer staring at a rose before they left, they said it was a gift. Why would they risk their life down here if someone cares about them so much?\n\nThat's exactly what I'm doing isn't it? I feel like I'm in over my head.",冬起十一日，叁柒陆年\n亲爱的爸妈，\n\n不知道老天是不是觉得那帮老鼠还不够恶心人，下水道更深处还有一群贼大的螃蟹！有只螃蟹我没能拦住它，它直接绕过我直直撞进队伍里了。大伙好不容易才弄死它，可那之前小李早被它伤惨了。队长说这不是我的错，但我知道他只是在安慰我。\n\n总算我们走运，回程途中我们碰上一个冒险家，她身上还有多的阳春草药膏。要是没那剂药膏，小李可能就没法活下来了。\n\n临别之前我看见那位冒险家盯着一朵玫瑰看了一会儿，对方说那是份给自己的礼物。真不明白，明明有人这么关心她，为什么她还要下去玩命呢？\n\n唉，想想自己不也是在做这种事吗？心里有点乱...
journal.document.sewers_guard.guild.title,The Thieves' Guild,盗贼公会
journal.document.sewers_guard.guild.body,"23rd of Winter, 376\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\nNo new monsters this time, instead we ran into a small group from the thieves' guild while on patrol.\n\nEverything I've heard about the guild is bad, but the rest of my team seemed almost friendly with them. Thomas exchanged information and supplies with one of them before we went our separate ways.\n\nI don't understand, weren't we supposed to be getting rid of outlaws? Thomas even said not to mention this to anyone in command. Their information and supplies were very useful though, and we couldn't handle even more fighting.\n\nI suppose we're all in this together down here.",冬起二十三日，叁柒陆年\n亲爱的爸妈，\n\n这次我们没碰上什么新怪物了，巡逻时倒是遇到一帮盗贼。\n\n我所听说的有关这帮法外之人的没一件好事，但我的队友和他们却已经走到可以称之为友善的、相当近的地步了。队长和其中一个盗贼交换了一些情报和物资，那之后我们就各走各路了。\n\n说实在话我不明白，难道我们来这里不就是要解决掉这帮人的吗？队长甚至还说别跟上级提起这档事。话又说回来，能不和那帮人打起来也挺好的：一来他们的情报和物资相当有用，二来我们也承受不起更多的战斗了。\n\n某种意义上，我们和他们在这地底下都是同伴啊。
journal.document.sewers_guard.lost.title,We're Lost,我们迷路了
journal.document.sewers_guard.lost.body,"40th of Winter, 376\n\nThomas and I are lost. We got driven away from the rest of the team while fighting some gnolls. Neither of us are hurt, but the lower sewers are like a maze.\n\nThomas says he knows a route out, but it starts at the old prison entrance at the bottom of the sewers. I really don't like going deeper, but we don't have any rations and going down is much faster than wandering around looking for our patrol route.\n\nIt'll be alright.

With all that's been going on lately, I've decided to start a journal to keep my thoughts in order.\n\nManaging a prison half a mile underground was never going to be easy, but lately it seems like some sort of organized disruption is happening. Inmates have been acting out for no reason and then refusing to explain why.\n\nSome of the guards are starting to say the place is haunted. I can't let my own people spread rumours, but I can't exactly blame them for being uneasy.\n- Smith",春至一日，叁陆贰年\n\n这是我，恰娜·史密斯身为监狱长的第一篇工作日志。基于最近发生的一系列事件，我决定用写日志来整理一下我的思绪。\n\n尽管管理一座深处地下半英里的监狱从来不是一件易事，但是最近发生的混乱似乎是有预谋的。囚犯们开始毫无缘由地作乱，事后却说不出个所以然。\n\n有些看守开始声称此地有妖鬼作祟，我自然不能让自己手下人如此散播谣言，但在如此工作环境之下也没法太过责备他们。\n——史密斯

It seems like the usual, a few promising ones and lots of grunts who just want the pay. Still, having all this new muscle should help a lot with our recent unruly inmates.\n\nIn a job like this it's important to know who you can trust. One new hire, Thomas, seems especially promising. I need all the help I can get right now, so if he does well I'll see about getting him promoted quickly.\n- Smith",春至八十日，叁陆贰年\n\n按照约定，今天有一批新狱卒来报道。和往常一样，有能力的狱卒不多，很多只是豪赏之下前来投名的莽夫。不管怎样，他们的蛮力在管教那些不听话的犯人时还是挺有用的。\n\n身处众人之上，培养几个心腹的重要性不言而喻。在这批新人中，托马斯的能力似乎可堪此任。眼下我需要任何形式的帮助，如果他表现不错，我会多多提拔他。\n——史密斯

I suppose the city doesn't want to bother maintaining the passage anymore. I wasn't informed beforehand, as usual.\n\nTheir head engineer also told me some nonsense about dwarven magic leaking in from the mines. I don't believe a word of it.\n\nThe situation is under much better control with our new staff, but the root of the problem still hasn't been addressed. Something is definitely affecting the inmates here, and knocking down a few walls isn't going to change that.\n- Smith",冬起五十四日，叁陆叁年\n\n今天有一群市府的工程师到访，声称要来封闭下面矿井的旧入口。市府大概是不想再耗费人力来管理它了。和往常一样，他们没有事先通知我。\n\n他们中的领队还同我提到有什么矮人魔力正从矿井中逸散而出。我反正是不信那鬼话。\n\n在新狱卒们的帮助下，监狱的情况好转了不少，但是问题的根源并没有查明，毫无疑问，这里有什么东西在影响着囚犯，这肯定也不是拆几面墙就能解决的问题。\n——史密斯

It's some sort of bright red shrub called a 'Rotberry'.\n\nI've mentioned how dreary this place is to him before, seems he was listening. According to him this plant actually dislikes light and water, so I just have to trim the leaves back once a month or so. Trimming it must be important though, he mentioned it a dozen times in his letter.\n\nOf course, Felix never does anything for free. He says that the seeds this thing produces are great for making wands, so naturally I owe him a few each time the plant produces some.\n- Smith",秋临二十三日，叁陆叁年\n\n今日收到了菲利斯赠送的一件妙礼，是一株亮红色的灌木丛，名为“腐莓”。\n\n我之前跟他抱怨过这个地方有多么冷清，看来这是他的回应。他说这种植物反而怕光怕水，只需要每月修剪枝叶就可以养活。修剪的必要性能从他在信里十数遍的反复强调读出来。\n\n不过，菲利斯当然不会做没有回报的事情。他说这个东西结下的籽是制作法杖的好材料，所以它每次结籽后我都需要给他寄回一把。就当欠他的了。\n——史密斯

Do they plan to just let this keep getting worse until we're dealing with a riot!?\n\nThomas has stayed reliable as ever at least. His organizational help has been invaluable, and his idea to activate those old DM-100 units was regrettable but necessary. I'm confident I can get back on top of this situation, I just need some damned support!\n-Smith",春至十一日，叁陆肆年\n\n市府到底在盘算着什么？从我紧急求援后一直杳无音信，连平时拒绝我的请求用的客套致歉都没有。\n\n囚徒每况愈下，甚至连一些狱卒也开始滋事。市府难道想放任情势恶化，酿成一场暴动给我们收拾！？\n\n至少托马斯还是一如既往地可靠。他的组织管理协助难能可贵。重启那些旧DM-100机器也是托马斯的主意，可悲但是实属无奈。我自信有能力解决这场问题，但我他娘的需要资源支持！\n——史密斯

After establishing a base camp, we set out exploring some of the upper areas of the abandoned mine. While there is plenty of useless clutter left by the dwarves, many of the cave walls are also teeming with gold!\n\nUnfortunately, we aren't the first ones here. The caves are rife with aggressive wildlife, and it seems packs of gnolls have an interest in the gold as well. I admit that I was unfair toward my guard escort, they have been much more capable explorers and bodyguards than I expected.\n\nEven with this success, we still have much of the mines left to explore.\n- Archibald",夏归四日，叁零捌年\n\n我们头几天的收获真算得上是盆满钵满！建好营地之后，我们初步探查了一下废弃矿井的上层部分。虽然这里有很多矮人遗留的废弃物，但我们发现洞窟的很多石壁里也充满了黄金！\n\n不幸的是，我们并不是第一批到这来的。洞窟里到处都是武德充沛的野生动物，并且一群群的豺狼人貌似也对黄金有着浓厚的兴趣。我承认我对我那护卫队的评价有点太刻薄了，其实他们是一群比我想象中更有能耐的探险者和保镖。\n\n尽管取得了这样的成功，这矿井还有很多区域等待我们去探索。\n——亚奇博尔德
journal.document.caves_explorer.troll.title,Met a Troll,遇到巨魔
journal.document.caves_explorer.troll.body,"11th of Summer, 308\n\nAfter beginning our exploration into the midsection of the mines, we ran into a friendly face! Well... relatively friendly. A cave troll has set up a little smithy there. He is gruff and not very talkative, but did repair our equipment in exchange for some gold.\n\nUnfortunately, the troll blacksmith has also informed us that all of this lovely gold isn't quite as good as it seems. He calls it 'dark gold' and it apparently rapidly degrades in sunlight. That would certainly explain why there were never any conflicts over the resources here.\n\nI suppose we need to delve a little deeper to see if there is anything more valuable.\n- Archibald",夏归十一日，叁零捌年\n\n在我们向矿井中层进发时，我们邂逅了一张友善的面孔！嗯···应该说是相对友善的面孔。一个洞窟巨魔在这开了个小铁匠铺。这家伙生性冷淡，不善言辞，不过为了换取一些黄金而修补了一下我们的装备。\n\n不幸的是，这巨魔铁匠也告诉我们，这些可爱的黄金并不像它看上去那样不怕火炼。他管这种黄金叫“暗金”，原因是这东西但凡碰到阳光马上就会融化。这也就解释了为什么这里从来没发生过和金矿有关的争端。\n\n我觉得我们得挖得更深一点，看看有没有什么更有价值的东西。\n——亚奇博尔德

We found various metal contraptions and a great gate which blocks entry to the old dwarven metropolis.\n\nThe blacksmith warned us about some of this machinery. It was apparently meant for area defense and has a tendency to activate when disturbed. We have no business in the city, and the metal would have minimal scrap value, so we thought it best to heed his warning and head back out.\n\nI must admit I was curious, but investigating down there certainly wasn't worth the risk.\n- Archibald",夏归二十一日，叁零捌年\n\n三周之期已到，最近的十天里，我们花费了大量的时间更加深入地绘制图表，现在我们终于到达了矿井的底端。我们发现了多种稀奇古怪的机械，以及一面巨大的、将旧矮人都城入口完全封死的巨型铁门。\n\n那铁匠警告过我们，对付有些机械造物要格外小心。这些机械显然是被用来防守这片区域，在受到扰动就后激活。我们没打算进入都城，而且那些机器也没什么回收价值，所以我们觉得最好还是把这警告当回事，是时候调头返回了。\n\n我必须承认我的好奇心还没得到满足，不过接着往下调查属实是风险高于回报了。\n——亚奇博尔德

We were merely passing by when it charged and almost crushed two of our group with its huge metal fists. Luckily, I was carrying my wand of disintegration with me. A few well-aimed blasts from that and the beastly thing was reduced to scrap metal.\n\nWhat troubles me is that we did absolutely nothing to provoke the machine. The dwarves couldn't possibly have designed the machines to be so aggressive, it's as if it was trying to ambush us!\n\nAt least I was able to offer some help to my companions for once.\n- Archibald",夏归二十三日，叁零捌年\n\n一个矮人机械竟然活起来了！我们只是路过它而已，它却向我们径直冲来，差点将两名队员压在它的巨大铁拳下。所幸的是，我刚好带着我的解离法杖。轰击它的几处关键部位后，那个巨兽般的大家伙就只剩破铜烂铁了。\n\n最令我不安的是，我们完全没有挑拨这个机器。那帮矮人难道真的把这些机械设计得如此具有进攻性？它仿佛是在给我们下埋伏！\n\n还好我这次能帮上同伴们一点忙。\n——亚奇博尔德

Just in time as well, several of our group have begun having terrible nightmares following the incident with the aggressive machine. It's probably just fatigue, but their nightmares are all worryingly similar.\n\nIn summary, the upper areas of the mine are quite safe. If a use could be found for dark gold then mining it may be quite lucrative. The large open spaces would work very well for the city's construction plans as well. The lower mines are more dangerous however, and should be avoided.\n\nI'll write all this into my final report over the next few days.\n- Archibald",夏归二十八日，叁零捌年\n\n我们要在今天收拾完行装，准备启程返回。时机也正好，多名队员都在被机械攻击的那场事件后开始做可怕的噩梦。也许只是大家都疲劳过度，但他们做的梦都相似到离奇。\n\n总结一下，矿井的上层部分比较安全。如果能为暗金找到用途，那么在此采矿将利润丰厚。这里开阔的空间也将适合市府的建设计划。但矿井的下层部分有较大的危险，应该避免靠近。\n\n我会在这几天把详情全部写进我的最终报告里。\n——亚奇博尔德

The rest of the court submitted to him, like the fools they are, and lost their free will in the process. I alone saw this coming and fled before his ritual could be completed.\n\nThe inner circle has fallen, but the New King's power has not yet reached everyone. I must mount a resistance as quickly as possible. I refuse to let our glorious civilization fall to this megalomaniac!",今天是法历叁拾叁年贰月伍日。如读者来自地上，可换算为冬历贰陆肆年某日。我是提穆尔・扎希尔，据我知悉，我是矮人议会的最后一名幸存者。\n\n我们的旧王已死，继位的是我一位沉溺于力量而走火入魔的前同僚。愚痴的其余议员全都服从于他，渐渐丢了自己的心志。我是唯一预见这一切的人，从而在他完成仪式前逃于一难。\n\n宫廷近臣已全部堕落，幸好新王的力量尚未触及每一个人。我必须集结反抗势力，不可浪费一分一秒。我不能放任伟大的矮人文明毁在这自大狂的手里！

Few are skilled with magic, but almost the entire order of warrior monks is among us. We should be more than a match for one crazed dwarf and his court of slaves.\n\nMeanwhile the New King has hidden himself in the inner chambers of our city. No doubt he has expended most of his power and is hoping to recover before he encounters more resistance.\n\nWe will launch our attack in another couple of hours. With luck we will be able to form an interim council and return our wondrous city to stability by the end of the night.",消息一传十，十传百。只花了几天我就组织起了一个忠于旧王的小部队。虽然鲜有熟用法术的人，但几乎整个武僧门派都加入了我们。以我们的阵仗，对付一介疯矮子和他的走狗们不在话下。\n\n与此同时，新王躲进了都城的深处。他无疑已经耗尽了大部分力量，正指望在遭遇反抗前恢复气力。\n\n再候几时就要发动进攻了。若一切如意，我们在天明前就可以建立临时议会，将我们美好的城邦扶回正轨。

I assumed that the New King needed the court to submit to him willingly, but now I see that he has the power to control even those who resist him.\n\nI blindly brought all of the strongest opposition right to his doorstep so that he could personally turn them into his slaves. Now waves of his necrotic energy are washing through the city, instantly turning most into his supplicants.\n\nThe few who still have free will are fleeing. I have chosen to stay behind to observe as best I can and look for an opening. With the magic power I have I should be able to stay hidden and safe for some time.",看来我也不过是又一个愚痴的人罢了。我原以为新王需要议会自愿臣服于他，但我现在才知道，他的力量足以直接操纵反对者。\n\n我盲目地把最有望扳倒他的军团送到他的阶下，让他们全都被新王亲手化为奴仆。之后，他的死灵之力放肆地洗刷着整座城市，将百姓们尽数转化为他的信徒。\n\n少数侥幸留有心志的人都在逃离。但我选择留下，尽可能地观察局面，期盼着事情能出现转机。凭借我所拥有的魔法能力，我应该能藏得一时安夷。

Every day the force of his will becomes stronger, but it is also changing. I cannot describe it, but it feels as if he is no longer a dwarf at all.\n\nI'm beginning to accept that the best I can probably hope to do is document these events. I will stay here for as long as I can, and then retreat once my will begins to weaken.",记录时间变得不再容易，但离我上则笔记应该过了一周。我们的文明毫无疑问已经崩溃，城门被关上了，社会功能全面停摆，大厅里满是失了魂的矮人躯壳在四处徘徊。\n\n经过了这一切，不知为何新王的力量还在变得更加强大。他的意志每天都在增长，但同时也在变质。我无法清楚地描述这种变化，但我感觉他已不是个矮人了。\n\n我开始接受这一事实——我能做的只有记录好这一切。我会尽可能长久地在这里待着。不过一旦我的意志开始变的孱弱，我就会撤离。

Perhaps the New King has a weakness after all?",这里到底在发生些什么？新王散发的力量已经与最初的完全不同，而且城里还存在着别的什么东西。这股新力量似乎是从城内最深处的大厅里辐射而出。\n\n更令人困惑的是，上城区的活动也减少了，我不知道那里发生了什么，但那至少吸引了新王几乎全部的注意力。\n\n重新回到深处的大厅无疑会很危险。但我必须找出是什么引发了这一变故。也许还能发现新王的弱点呢？

Please guide me my king, use me as an instrument to hold Yog-Dzewa at bay!",我见着底下藏着些什么了，那是不可言状之物。仅仅是试图书写这些见闻，我的双手就抑制不住地颤抖。\n\n为什么？这是新王做的吗？狗屁不通。是他对力量肆无忌惮的滥用引来的吗？我本只是想拯救我们的文明，但现在看来陷入危机的是整个世界。\n\n从某些方面来说，新王不过是小恶罢了。为了大善，我别无选择，只能献上自己。陛下啊，请指引我，以我为剑，抗击Yog-Dzewa！

I think I'll allow him to continue, so that he can deliver all of his conspirators right to my door!\n\nClearly the kingdom doesn't respect me either, I suppose I'll fix that as well.\n- King of the Dwarves",啊哈哈哈哈哈，朕即位了！\n\n这群蠢货竟然真的同意了！还没等朕打算认真说服，他们就同意参与朕这场为了和他们“共享”力量而举行的大型仪式。只消一会，这群喋喋不休且傲慢不已的蠢货就都转化成了沉默且服从的新议会眷属！\n\n如朕所料，提穆尔在发现情况不对的第一时间就仓皇而逃。朕也能感知到他在外界试图组建的叛军。朕打算坐享其成，让他帮朕将这些反抗者都聚集于此一网打尽！\n\n很明显，就连这个国家都不尊重我这个新王，新官上任尚且需要三把火，新王登基自然不能矮了身段。\n——矮人国王

journal.document.halls_king.thing.body,"There's a problem. Thymor was dispatched without effort, but it seems my scrounging in the outer planes did not go unnoticed.\n\nSome... 'thing'... has been attracted to my world and is starting to force itself through at the bottom of the lower halls. To complicate things further, that is the exact location where I stored the amulet! Such a spiteful creature, why must it try to deny me my power when there is plenty out there still to take?\n\nDespite my power though, I don't think I can just charge in and fight it. Its true power is unfathomable, but there must be some way to limit it. I WILL DEFEND MY PRIZE!",有麻烦了，虽然和提穆尔没什么关系，他苍白无力的抵抗早已被迅速扑灭，不过朕在外位面的探索似乎吸引到了不必要的注意。\n\n一个...“存在”...被引到了本位面，祂正在逼近城市厅堂的最下层。麻烦的事情在于，那也正好是朕存放护符的区域！真是个可憎的造物，为何放着外位面充盈的能量不要，专门跑来试图夺走朕的东西？\n\n纵是强大如朕，也无法亲征讨伐此怪。其真实实力不可估量，但朕也有可行之策。朕必会守住护符！

journal.document.halls_king.attrition.body,"I have a plan for dealing with the thing. Its power is infinite, but its ability to encroach on this world is not. It's relying on minions and avatars to do its bidding while it tries to build enough power to take the amulet.\n\nWhile I don't possess the amulet physically I still have full control over its power. With the entire dwarven city at my disposal I also have a numbers advantage. I can simply keep sending soldiers to prevent it from seizing the amulet and steadily win this war through attrition!\n\nI, RODNEY, KING OF DWARVES, WILL OUTLAST YOU YOG-DZEWA!",朕已有一计可应对此孽。诚然其力量几近无限，然其蚕食本位面的能力受限颇多。祂仍需其恶魔爪牙与化身的协助才能积蓄力量，一举夺走护符。\n\n护符虽不在身旁，但其神力仍寄宿于朕。掌控矮人都城本身也意味着朕有压倒性的人数优势。将兵力源源不断地送入大厅，朕就能阻止其攫取护符，通过消耗战赢得胜利！\n\nYog-Dzewa！朕，Rodney，矮人之王，才 会 笑 到 最 后！
